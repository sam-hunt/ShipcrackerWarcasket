# Harmony and VFE Pirates). The defs carry MayRequire on two stat LEAVES
# (VacuumResistance for Odyssey, SlaveSuppressionOffset for Ideology); a
# gated leaf drops a number, not a def, so neither DLC changes the key set
# the probe dumps. Odyssey is required anyway because it is the mod's
# planned compat gate (LoadFolders.xml's commented Mods/Odyssey roots): the
# moment an Odyssey-only def or DefInjected lands, a sidecar generated
# without Odyssey would silently lose its keys, and pinning the DLC now
# means that change needs no shim edit. Ideology stays out: nothing here
# will ever gate translatable content on it.
